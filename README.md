# semantic-tagging
bootcamp homework #1

# description
for this assignment, we were to take an html and css document and replace div tags with more specific semantic tags, as div is a non semantic tag, and is broad. the goal was to change the tags to the correct semantic tags while keeping the wbesite the same as the original we got. We also had to add alt tags to each photo, giving a brief description of each, as well as changing the title of the website.
