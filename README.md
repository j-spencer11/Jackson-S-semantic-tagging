bootcamp homework #1

for this assignment, we were to take an html and css document and replace <div> tags with more specific semantic tags, and <div> is a non semantic tag, and is broad. the goal was to change the tags to the correct semantic tags while keeping the wbesite the same as the original we got. We also had to add alt tags to each photo, giving a brief description of each, as well as changing the title of the website.
